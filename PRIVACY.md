## Privacy

### Privacy Statement

This privacy statement describes how json2chart collects, uses, and protects user data during operation. We are committed to ensuring the security and privacy of your information.

### Information Collection

This plugin requires the following information during operation:

- **JSON Data**: The data you provide for chart generation, which may contain various types of information.
- **Chart Parameters**: Configuration parameters such as chart type, title, saturation, brightness, etc.
- **LLM Model Configuration**: If applicable, model parameters used for intelligent data analysis.

**Note**: All data is only used temporarily during the plugin's execution. It will not be stored or transmitted to third-party servers unnecessarily, and complies with the "principle of data minimization" for privacy protection.

### Information Usage

- **Data Processing**: Process the JSON data you provide to extract fields, convert data types, and prepare for chart generation.
- **Intelligent Analysis**: If enabled, use large language models to analyze data structures and recommend visualization options.
- **Chart Generation**: Create ECharts configuration based on processed data and user parameters.
- **Result Return**: Return the generated chart configuration as text output.

### Commitments

- We do not record or analyze the content of your JSON data beyond what is necessary for chart generation.
- We do not store your data persistently after the chart generation process is complete.
- We do not share your data with any third parties except as required for the core functionality of the plugin.

### Data Security

- **Temporary Processing**: All data processing occurs in memory and is cleared after operation.
- **Local Execution**: The core chart generation functionality runs locally without sending your data to external servers.
- **LLM Interaction**: If large language models are used, only the necessary data samples are sent for analysis, not the entire dataset.

### User Responsibilities

- **Data Quality**: Ensure the JSON data you provide is properly formatted and contains appropriate information for visualization.
- **Data Sensitivity**: Be cautious when processing sensitive or confidential information, as the plugin may use external language models for analysis.

### Policy Updates

Changes to this Privacy Statement will be announced through updates to the plugin documentation. Your continued use of the plugin after such changes constitutes acceptance of the updated privacy policy.
